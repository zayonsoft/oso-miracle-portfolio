          Propifix was more than just a real estate website - it was a journey
          into solving trust, accessibility, and user experience issues in
          property discovery and transaction. By designing with clarity and user
          empowerment in mind, we created a platform where listings aren’t just
          displayed - they’re trusted, verified, and easy to act upon. Every
          feature, from inspection booking to profile verification, was built to
          bridge the gap between agents and serious buyers.

          This project sharpened my skills in dealing with complex workflows,
          managing stakeholder needs, and prioritizing user clarity in an
          industry often riddled with opacity. Propifix now stands as a
          confident, scalable solution for modern property search, with a strong
          foundation for future integration of mortgage tools, agent analytics,
          and smart property suggestions.
