    "It’s tailored for users who want more than just a wallet - they want an intelligent financial companion. I focused on designing intuitive user journeys across complex features like AI voice navigation (Vira), chat assistant support (Cira), spending insights, and low-interest loan offers with reward-based memberships. Fundity is especially suited for modern individuals who juggle multiple accounts, need real-time alerts, and want deeper insights into their financial habits - all presented through a clean, scalable UI system.",

  challengeParagrahs: [
    "Designing an all-in-one banking experience that covers loans, AI assistants, financial education, biometrics, and fraud detection was a challenge of scale and clarity. Users could easily get lost in the overwhelming number of features without clear organization or guidance.",
  ],
  solutionParagraphs: [
    "Fundity tackled this by creating a modular design system with hubs for each function - Loan Hub, Card Hub, Insights, and AI Support. ‘Cira’ and ‘Vira’ were introduced as separate AI entities with clearly defined roles, so users could access help or navigation without confusion. The interface kept things structured yet flexible, giving both power users and beginners a smooth ride.",
